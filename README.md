#Network theory
 
Creating the graph
-------------------------
The PDF I have attached is the graph of my social network connections on Facebook. It is made using “Gephi” a software that visualises networks. I downloaded Gephi onto my computer and from my Facebook account searched the word “netvizz” to get my personal network in a PDF format.  
I first imported the file to Gephi and a grey square with dots and lines appeared which reflected my social network visually. Every dot on the graph represented a node - my friends on Facebook and every line represented an edge - the connection and interpersonal ties between my friends on Facebook. 
I changed the layout to Force Atlas 2 which suited my network the most as it segregated the different network more than other layouts and visualised clearly of the communities within my Facebook. 

I wanted to know which cluster meant what group so I ran “Modularity” then on “Partition” I applied “Modularity class” which colour coded my network. 
To know which friends had a lot of connections with my other friends, I ran “Average Degree” which calculates how many degrees are in each node. On “Ranking” I clicked the diamond shaped button and chose “Indegree” or “Outdegree”, as Facebook is a direct network as if you’re friends with someone they’ll have you as a friend too in which case it doesn’t matter which degree you chose.  I choose the maximum size and the minimum size of nodes and when I apply it some nodes who know many people who I know would appear much bigger than another. 
I clicked nodes were which people, I hit the Text button to see the names of people, which will inform me more about the graph. 
Finally I exported the graph into a PDF format.

Influence, Bonding and Bridging
-------------------------------------------
#Purple clusters 

the furthest one from everyone else are people from my first secondary school I attended in first and second year from Wicklow. They are bonded strongly as they are in the same community geographically. Some of these purple are connected to my pink clusters as they are my new friends I made in UCD as some of the people from the school in Wicklow are now attending UCD.  

* Turquoise and the light blue clusters

These are friends I got to know through my friends who influenced my communities of friends. Most of the turquoise and blue clusters are in the same year in school so you can see a lot of bridging across the groups and bonding within the groups. 

* Yellowish green cluster 

They are people from my second secondary school.  

* Orange cluster

After that I moved to my third secondary school which are the people in the orange cluster at the top of the graph. 

* Purple cluster

And through the people in my third school I got to know a group of people from another big school which are the purple clusters who knew a lot of people from the two schools I went so there are a lot of bridging across those three communities. 

The purple and the yellowish green clusters are not connected my turquoise and light blue clusters as they are in different years of school so there would be less chance of interactions, however many of them “know of” each other and some things for example the fashion and places they go to still is influenced even if they don’t know each other directly.

* Green cluster & light blue clusters 

These are my co-workers from a Japanese restaurant I worked in and there are other Japanese people in that cluster as well as some of the co-workers knows the Japanese people and the little green cluster just below are my co-workers from my current work place. 

Closeness, Betweenness and Eigenvector Centrality
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest node on the graph at the bottom of orange is my bestfriend so she has high betweenness centrality as I introduced her to one or a few people from each of my communities of friends so she is connected to with both  homogenous and heterogenetic  groups.
Some of the people from the turquoise sector would be high eigenvector centrality as many of them know a lot of people who knows a lot of people as they have connections to many schools in Dublin. 
There is a friend at the bottom yellowish green cluster from one of my schools and she skipped transition year has a high closeness centrality as she knows the two different years of the school.
